# NgTwitter

This project is a test project from the company which I had an interview with. It's also a project of learning Angular framework for me, due to I had no Angular2, 3, 4, 5, 6 experience before. I take this project as an example to figure out how things work in Angular such as data structure, writing components, uni testing... etc.

## Intalling project
Run `git clone git@github.com:ReacherYin/ngTwitter.git` to download the repository, and go to the root directory, run `npm start` to start the app on your local machine.

You are gonna see the app on your browser at http://localhost:4200/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
